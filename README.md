# Portfolio Project

My personal Portfolio to present my coding projects and a bit about me!

## About the project

This project gave me a chance to practice and refine making a fully responsive application that works across all devices. I designed the website using Invision and then reworked the design as needed as I implemented it. The webpage was then deployed via Netlify.

## Built with

- HTML
- css3
- Bootstrap

## What's next?

As I grow my portfolio, I also want to grow the website. Primarily, I want to make changes to the content as I progress as a developer: adding a section for blog posts, updating the _About Me_ page, and of course putting my new projects in _Work_.

Additionally, I would like to learn more css3 techniques and potentially add in some movement and animation where appropriate.

I guess it's time to buckle down and get cracking on more projects, more content and more learning ðŸ’ª
